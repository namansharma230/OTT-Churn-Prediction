# OTT-Churn-Prediction
The objective is to design an AI solution that predicts which OTT subscribers are likely to churn (cancel subscriptions). Churn is a binary classification problem (1 = churn, 0 = retain). By identifying at-risk users, stakeholders (e.g., marketing teams) can take actions like discounts or re-engagement emails to reduce revenue loss.
